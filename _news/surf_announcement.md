Finished 10-week mentoring program with CISTAR and Purdue REU (Research Experience for Undergraduate)

***

I had the wonderful opportunity to mentor incoming cohort of brilliant undergraduate student researchers as part of the SURF (Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowhip) program at Purdue University in collaboration with CISTAR NSF Engineering Research Center. The project was to develop machine leanrning models to classify reaction in multiple categories based on molecular fingerprints using cheminformatics tool and contemporary ML algorithms. The objective for the project was to clean, pre-process the training data, setup the training workflow for the model fitting, validate and optimize model parameters and test the model on the held-out test dataset. The expertise and dataset for the work was provided by [Savoie Group](https://engineering.purdue.edu/savoiegroup/) and [Data Mine](https://datamine.purdue.edu) at Purdue.
