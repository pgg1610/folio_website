Finished a 10-week mentoring program with [CISTAR](http://cistar.us) and Purdue REU (Research Experience for Undergraduate). 

***

I had the wonderful opportunity to mentor incoming cohort of four undergraduate student researchers as part of the SURF (Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowhip) program at Purdue University in collaboration with [CISTAR NSF Engineering Research Center](http://cistar.us) and [Data Mine](https://datamine.purdue.edu). 

The project was to develop and test a mutli-class machine learning classification models to classify chemical reactions based on molecular fingerprints. The objective for the project was to clean, pre-process the training data, setup the training workflow for the model fitting, validate and optimize model parameters, and finally, test the model on the held-out test dataset. The expertise and dataset for the work was provided by the [Savoie Group](https://engineering.purdue.edu/savoiegroup/) with the computational resources provided by [Data Mine](https://datamine.purdue.edu) and [RCAC](http://rcac.purdue.edu) at Purdue.

The mentoring assigment culminated with undergraduate researchers presenting their work at the annual SURF symposium and writing a research publication explaining their work and contribution. Two out of the four reseachers were recognized at the symposium for their work and awarded the ['Outstanding First Time Resarcher' Award](https://www.facebook.com/CISTAR.ERC/posts/4466608786712134).
