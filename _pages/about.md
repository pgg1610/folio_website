Hello! 

I'm Pushkar, an engineer-turned-scientist currently working as a research scientist in [Eli Lilly's](https://www.lilly.com/discovery/research-and-scientific-discovery) Global Discovery Chemistry & Cheminformatics team. I collaborate with medicine discovery teams to find innovative solutions to patient needs around the world. In particular, I develop AI-based methods to augment human creativity and maximize serendipity. I am broadly interested in chemistry and biology, with a passion for understanding how medicines are discovered, developed, and commercialized.

I completed my Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from [Purdue University](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChE) in August 2021. While at Purdue, I worked on building a molecule-level understanding of catalysts to further our knowledge of chemical transformations. This research aimed to improve energy storage and conversion devices like batteries.

[You can read more about my Ph.D. journey here](https://www.pushkarghanekar.com/blog/2021/phd_learning/).

Besides research, I love to teach and share science with as many people as possible. Outside of work, I enjoy [cooking](https://www.instagram.com/pgg1610/), gaming, diving deep in arcane internet rabbit holes, reading history and philosophy, and going on longer-than-necessary bike rides. Anything that keeps me away from doing laundry or dishes. 

I maintain a [data science blog](https://pgg1610.github.io/data_blog/) where I document my thoughts, tips, and list of helpful resources related to chemical science, algorithms, and code. 

Curiosity, humility, and empathy are my foundational beliefs.

Two principles drive my work: 
(i) insight must precede application
(ii) everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.

  <summary> More mental models I subscribe to:</summary>
  - Trust in compounding and persistence; you dont need to be right just less stupid.
  - Decide what you want, decide what you are willing to exchange for it.
  - Have strong convictions, loosely held. 
  - Follow curiosity and passion, not trends.
  - Ideas are not owned, but come with debts to those who came before. 
  - Life is surprisingly short, so solve problems that interest and excite you most. [Richard Hamming's Lecture](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.pdf)
  - Happiness is a choice that you make and a skill that you develop 
  - ["The days are long but the decades are short"](https://blog.samaltman.com/the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short)
  - Don't be the best, try to be the only.
