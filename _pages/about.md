Hello! 

I'm a research scientist in [Eli Lilly's](https://www.lilly.com/discovery/research-and-scientific-discovery) global discovery & cheminformatics team, engineer by training, interested in programming, history, philosophy, web3, and startups. Currently working on AI methods to augment human creativity and maximize serendipty. 

I completed my Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from [Purdue University](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChE). I worked on building molecule-level understanding of catalysts to further our understanding of chemical transformations and reaction dynamics. [You can read more about my Ph.D. journey here](https://www.pushkarghanekar.com/blog/2021/phd_learning/).

Besides research, I love to teach and share science with as many people as possible. 

Outside of work, I enjoy [cooking](https://www.instagram.com/pgg1610/), gaming, diving deep in arcane internet rabbit holes, and going on longer-than-necessary bike rides.

On the side, I maintain a [data science blog](https://pgg1610.github.io/blog_fastpages/) where I document my thoughts, tips, and list of helpful resources related to chemical science, algorithms, and code.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
