Hello! I'm Pushkar. 

I currently work as a Sr. Research Advisor in [Eli Lilly's](https://www.lilly.com/discovery/research-and-scientific-discovery) Global Discovery Chemistry & Cheminformatics team. I collaborate with medicine discovery teams to find innovative solutions to patient needs around the world. In particular, I develop AI-based methods to augment human creativity and maximize serendipity. I am broadly interested in chemistry and biology, with a passion for understanding how medicines are discovered, developed, and commercialized.

I completed my Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from [Purdue University](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChE) in August 2021. While at Purdue, I worked on building a molecule-level understanding of catalysts to further our knowledge of chemical transformations. This research aimed to improve energy storage and conversion devices like batteries.

[You can read more about my Ph.D. journey here](https://www.pushkarghanekar.com/blog/2021/phd_learning/).

Besides research, I love to teach and share science with as many people as possible. Outside of work, I enjoy [cooking](https://www.instagram.com/pgg1610/), gaming, diving deep in arcane internet rabbit holes, reading history and philosophy, and going on longer-than-necessary bike rides. Anything that keeps me away from doing laundry or dishes. 

I maintain a [data science blog](https://pgg1610.github.io/data_blog/) where I document my thoughts, tips, and list of helpful resources related to chemical science, algorithms, and code. 

Curiosity, humility, and empathy are my foundational beliefs.

Two principles drive my work: 

i. Intentionality must precede application

ii. How do you anything is how you do everything.

  <summary>Some core mental models I subscribe to:</summary>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Trust in compounding and persistence; you don't need to be always right, just less stupid.</li>
    <li>Decide what you want, decide what you are willing to exchange for it and get to work.</li>
    <li>Have strong convictions, loosely held.</li>
    <li>Follow curiosity and passion, not trends.</li>
    <li>Ideas are not owned, but come with debts to those who came before.</li>
    <li>Life is surprisingly short, so solve problems that interest and excite you most. <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.pdf">Richard Hamming's Lecture</a></li>
    <li>Happiness is a choice that you make and a skill that you develop.</li>
    <li><a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short">"The days are long but the decades are short"</a></li>
    <li>Don't be the best, try to be the only.</li>
  </ul>
