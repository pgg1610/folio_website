Hello! Welcome to my personal website. 

I am a recent Chemical Engineering Ph.D. graduate from [Purdue University](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChE). I was working with [Jeffrey P. Greeley](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChE/people/ptProfile?resource_id=84163) to understanding the molecular-level behavior of the catalyst through data and science. I love to work on interesting ways to solve difficult problems that would help improve quality of life. 

Besides research, I love to teach and share science with as many people as possible. 

Outside of work, I enjoy [cooking](https://www.instagram.com/pgg1610/), gaming, diving deep in arcane internet rabbit holes, reading philosophy, and going on longer-than-necessary bike rides.

I maintain a [data science blog](https://pgg1610.github.io/blog_fastpages/) where I document my thoughts, tips, and list of helpful resources

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
