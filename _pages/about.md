Hello! 

I'm Pushkar Ghanekar, engineer by training currently a research scientist in [Eli Lilly's](https://www.lilly.com/discovery/research-and-scientific-discovery) Global Discovery Chemistry & Cheminformatics team. My work involves developing AI-based methods in chemistry and synthesis-planning to augment human creativity and maximize serendipty. I am broadly interested in chemistry and biology with a passion to understand how medicine are dicovered, developed, and commercialized. 

I completed my Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from [Purdue University](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChE) in August 2021. While at Purdue, I worked on building molecule-level understanding of catalysts to further our understanding of chemical transformations and reaction dynamics. 

[You can read more about my Ph.D. journey here](https://www.pushkarghanekar.com/blog/2021/phd_learning/).

Besides research, I love to teach and share science with as many people as possible. 

Outside of work, I enjoy [cooking](https://www.instagram.com/pgg1610/), gaming, diving deep in arcane internet rabbit holes, reading history and philosophy, and going on longer-than-necessary bike rides. Anything that can jusitfy me not doing laundry or dishes. 

On the side, I maintain a [data science blog](https://pgg1610.github.io/data_blog/) where I document my thoughts, tips, and list of helpful resources related to chemical science, algorithms, and code.
