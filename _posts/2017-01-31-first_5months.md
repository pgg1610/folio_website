I don't know about anyone else but for me the initial days staying in America were tough. Having lived with my parents all my life and now being suddenly uprooted from the comforts of my bedroom and my moms wonderful homemade food was surely distressing. How for granted I had taken my parents. Being independent was fun but with it came baggage of keeping the house clean, paying the bills and maintaining finances. Living with parents, my dad was the central bank and mom the ATM. Now things got real I had to think twice before I made a pruchase. Use that "Do I want or do I need it" argument to coax my inner shoppoholic. The biggest of my pain of washing and folding my laundry. It was during this time I missed my mother the most. While I was tackling the problems of being alone and independent I also had to deal with the demanding coursework of the graduate schoool. It surely threw me off balance in the start. I had to reevaulate my methods. Being an above average student since my school days the Indian education system had molded me into an grade hungry learner whose prime motivation was to ace the test rather than to learn about the subject. Here it was different. Everyone in my batch was a above average student which made the competition fierce. We were tested on how my we understood the subject rather than how much we can regurgitate can a trained ape. I loved it. Though the learning curve was steep the experience was worthwhile. I had few episodes of feeling like an imposter but with time those healed.
