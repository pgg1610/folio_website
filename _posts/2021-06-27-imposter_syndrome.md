As someone who relates to the perils of imposter syndrome and has suffered from it for quite sometime, I see it as my strength, rather than a something to fear from. It keeps me on my toes. I am my biggest critique and I do not let positives cloud my judgement and sense. Analyzing the wins is as important as dissecting the loses, and having a feeling of imposter, atleastt for me, helps me address it. 

Now that being said, some days I can be overwhelming and those days there are following key Ideas that keep me grounded: 

1. You are generally a competent person 

2. There are always going to be people that know more about certain area than _you_ and that’s perfectly fine. In fact, seek them out and see what they know, take in their wisdom and learn from them. 

3. You have finite amount of time to learn things; figure out areas to invest your energy in. Your goal shouldn’t be learn the most but rather learn skills that maximize your specific goals. Have a priority list (maybe make one by taking assistance of mentors or those in a position you would want to be in), see what are the skills that have got them there.
