I often come across young graduates who work at a large management consulting, investment banks, or even marketing firms. They hate their job and want to join a startup. Despite this, they stay for the lure of boss' promises of a raise and greater responsibility, I call this the 'golden handcuffs'. 

A lot of the successful people I've come to know look at their life in chapters. Some chapters are good, some are bad, some are amazing and world knows them for it. Through all of this they have exercised the knack to learn, show-up, and reinvent themselves.

So this brings me to question, why do some smart, ambitious people stay in careers they don't love? And some are able to move out and explore? 

## The Hill Climbing Problem

In computation chemistry, in particular computer science, there is an algorithmic practise of 'Hill climbing'. It involves finding the highest point on hilly terrain by taking steps upward. This hill finding can be used to optimize a solution of practical importance. Now doing this only once, you risk ending up on a smaller hill if you start near one.

An improvement on this idea is the method of simulated annealing: starting with random steps to explore the terrain, then gradually reducing randomness. This helps find the highest hill before focused climbing.

## Career Lessons from Simulated Annealing

The job candidate knows he wants to be on a different career hill. However, the lure of immediate rewards keeps him on his current path. Behavioral economists note that people overvalue near-term rewards, a trap for ambitious individuals.

Young professionals should learn from simulated annealing: explore different paths early, embrace randomness, and when you identify your desired peak, commit to it, even if it means starting from scratch or taking a step back.

## Embrace Multiple Minimas

Reaching a higher peak sometimes requires descending first. This might involve relearning skills or starting anew in a different industry. In the long run, this leads to greater fulfillment.

In summary, apply simulated annealing to your career: explore, take risks, and focus on long-term goals. Don't let short-term gains trap you in a career that doesn't align with your true ambitions.
