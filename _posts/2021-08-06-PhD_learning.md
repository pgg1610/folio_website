This essay is a reflection on my Ph.D. journey at Purdue University. In this essay, I list a few reasons I motivated me to pursue a Ph.D., learnings during the journey, and some tips that might be helpful for someone planning to pursue one in the future. 

> It goes without saying that everyone's Ph.D. experience is different, influenced by multiple factors and difficult to generalize, so in that spirit treat the learning and pointers in this essay as my opinion and reflections and nothing more. 

### Expectations going into a Ph.D.

Coming of age in India during the late 2010s, you were given two career choices: Either be a doctor or an engineer. This shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone who is from India or knows any from the subcontinent. My childhood began with a similar choice. Luckily I gravitated towards the idea of figuring out how things work and pursuing an engineering track. I always wanted to in computer science but did not get enough marks to pursue it in a well-reputed institution. The decision to pursue chemical engineering was part motivated from dad's trajectory and knowing the program offered at Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai (India). After completing an undergraduate in Chemical Engineering, the options for industry positions were not as exciting as I had thought initially and the MBA course was again blocked by a cut throat entrance exams to which I had already build some mental repulsion. I viewed a Ph.D. track as a financially responsible way to widen my knowledge and pursue independence. 

My expectations going into a Ph.D. were that I would be working with an advisor of my choice on an problem for 5-ish years, I will talk, write, and share the knowledge and findings with the community and be called a 'Doctor' eventually. Now, broadly speaking, this is exactly what happened, but zooming in, the five-year journey was anything but as straight forward as I would've thought. I came to Purdue to pursue a Ph.D. in computational fluid dynamics, something I dabbled in during my undergraduate life, but later found the process of choosing an advisor was not as straightforward as I thought. I chose the field of computational catalysis as my main concentration knowing the exciting work being done at Purdue and my inclination in having a computational Ph.D. 

**Why?** 

To be fair, I didnt give the _why_ any consideration as much as I did the _how_. My undergraduate course had, and still does, a _system_ and a structure which I am do not completely agree to but nevertheless was a wonderful launching pad to pursue a graduate course. I feel the emphasis on pure academic record to determine your graduate course is well-intentioned but reductionist, that's a topic in and of itself. Talking with few seniors and mentors in graduate schools, following were some thoughts which made me want to pursue a Ph.D. 

**Status.** Irrespective of whether it should be the case or not, pursuing and eventually getting a PhD degree is recognized as an impressive achievement and is socially validating. You get to be a Doctor. My parents always wished I become a medical doctor. So this was a happy middle, I guessed. 

**Financial optimal route to independence.** Starting an independent life is an important rite of passage to adulthood. Pursuing a Masters in US seemed to be financial burden not everyone could sustain. Which made doing a PhD a reasonable decision to avail the elusive financial and social independence. A PhD will offer you a lot of freedom in the topics you wish to pursue and learn about. Of course, you’ll have an adviser who will impose some constraints but in general you’ll have much more freedom than you might find elsewhere.

**Expertise.** I always loved to understand why things work the way they do. PhD is the only opportunity in life to really drill deep into a topic to answer that very question and get paid while doing so. You’re exploring the edge of our knowledge as a species, without the burden of lesser distractions or constraints. There’s something beautiful about that and if you disagree, it could be a sign that PhD is not for you.

### Key learnings

Besides the technical skills and knowledge I have garnered from my wonderful collaborators and community in this five-year journey, following are certain meta-skills I've learned during my Ph.D.

**1. How to think for yourself: The cook vs the chef**

In common parlance cook and chef is generally used interchangeably but in the culinary world, a cook is someone who prepares food following a recipe, someone who is just getting started, meanwhile, a chef is a person who invents the recipe, gives it personality and a twist. I feel working on a Ph.D. is similar to this journey. You first start as a line cook, following a recipe, learning the trick of trade from the broader community and your research advisor, until one day you earn your stripes and become a sous chef who plans and assists the head chef on recipes. Toiling in obscurity, Ph.D. taught me how to be an independent critical thinking, consider edges cases, and understanding the assumptions that go into it. How to work toward goals that are neither clearly defined nor externally imposed.

**2. Learning how to learn**

Following on the first point, learning how to learn is an important meta-skill I learne during my Ph.D. When looking at a topic of interest, planning how you would get the most of the insights in a limited time is key. This step involves, seeking and planning collaborations. Debugging your way through the literature and common knowledge in the community. Developing an intuition around the field and the state-of-the-art. I have found nicely written reviews a nice place to start in this venture. The learning process for any new skill can be broken down into 4 parts: Deconstruction (break the idea into digestable chunks), Selection (select the most useful/important chunks), Sequence (learn the priority of each chunk in importance), and Stakes (have skin in the game or accountability when learning about it, potentially a literature review or discussion with your advisor, give yourself a deadline). 

**3. Asking (right) questions**

Ph.D. as much as is doing the actual work and slogging hard on writing code or setting up experiments is also about asking the right question. Emphasis on the word _right_. There are some questions that are interesting but are difficult to answer in the current day and age or are so fraught with the competition. During your Ph.D. you will spend a good 2/3 years searching for questions you would want to answer. That doesn't mean you won't be working towards it, but articulating it in a way that aligns with you is going to take some time. 

For every question, you will break it down in chunks of hypothesis. Formulating hypothesis and devise subsequent experiment to address is an important meta-skill that a Ph.D. will teach you. No matter the subject of your Ph.D. it would give you the tools to implement critical thinking, follow a scientific method in your daily life. Besides asking questions you will learn how to formulate a hypothesis. 


### Common challenges during the Ph.D.

Besides the percevied autonomy, fulfillment, and success, sprinkled with copious societal validation that follows when pursuing a Ph.D., the journey isn't always rainbows and roses. My Ph.D. was punctuated with periods of anxiety, nervousness, writing block, and borderline depression, especially when grieving the unexpected loss of my dad, navigating through a unsuccessful project renewal(s), and job search. The COVID-19 pandemic added further to my laundry list of problems which already included uncertainty with of post-Ph.D. future. 

Under stress and uncertainty, we usually tend to close up, live in the past and ruminate about have-been and could-be's in our head. I was guilty of it as well. Eventually, I found it was worthwhile to talk my heart out to selected few. My partner was crucial in this phase. I found three key areas / feelings that time-and-again were the reason for my anxiety and stress. I outline them below and list few tips which helped me out and hope might help you too:  

**1. Feeling of being stuck**

In your Ph.D. it is usually the case that you will work toward goals that are neither clearly defined nor externally imposed. One of the most harrowing experiences during this time is when you feel stuck in an area of work with no clear line of sight. Few tips I have found useful in tackling this have been: 

(a) _Embrace the feeling._ When things go as planned, lot of us pretend we know what's happening. But sometimes it is just dumb luck in our favor. Usually we attribute success to our skills but failure to external noise. You learn more when things aren't working. No other feeling will teach you more about your psyche than the feeling of being stuck. Learn about your thought process, the assumptions that went into it, and the gaps in your knowledge. 

(b) _Zoom out._ Look at the forest than the leaves. Understand the overarching implications of your work and the area you are in. Read review articles and get an idea of the state-of-the-art. It is easy to be lost in the weeds and lose focus of the vast beautiful forest you are in. Appreciate its glory and then get back into it. Reframe and re-cast your challenge.

(c) _Draft a write-up._ Write what have done so far, processes used. I have found it useful to jot down my ideas and thoughts in a workflow and iterate it.

(e) _Take a break._ Go for a walk. Dont look at your project or code for a good few days and come back to it with a fresh perspective. That has helped me find bugs in my code which in the hindsight were literally in front of me. 

(e) _Exercise._ Good exercise routine and diet has a huge effect on your mental well being and general productivity. Even simple walking for atleast 15 mins a day makes a huge difference. 

(f) _Remember you are not your research._ There is life beyond Ph.D. research. Have a side activity/hobby to unwind and detach. 

(g) _Advisor/Mentor feedback._ I would recommend this step only after you have done the above options. In most cases, you have a better understanding of the technicalities of the project than your advisor but this is where their accumulated wisdom and experience comes in hand.

**2. Fear of missing out (FOMO)**

To put it plainly, the onslaught of information through the internet is overwhelming for our 10,000 year old hunter-gather brains. This feeling is exacerbated with the rampant promotion of 'exciting'  and 'ground breaking' research your colleagues might share on social media. 

(a) _Limit social media usage._  especially LinkedIN and Twitter. They have given me unprecedented access to network of information and people  which has been fun but at the same time exposed me to moments of FOMO, anxiety, and languish. Be wary of their infinite scrolling and 'the feed'.

(b) _Dont chase someone else’s definition of success._ This follows the point (a), there is much more to the person than pure citations, followers, and likes, you are unaware of their internal state of mind and personal life as they are yours. 

(c) _Do not oversubscribe to journals' RSS feeds_

(d) _Have a reading strategy:_ Keep a reading list. Stick to it. I personally maintain a simple excel spreadsheet that lists the name, key area, link, and findings of the paper. Usually skimming the abstract, last paragraph of the introduction and conclusion you'll get a fair idea of what the paper has to say.

**3. Toiling in obscurity**

(a) _Support network._ Talk about your research with your peers. Develop a small net of trust-worthy connections where you can share your intimate thought - this could be your partners, research lab colleagues, or friends. When doing so make sure you the choosing your circle and aren't socially pressured into one. 

(b) _Enjoy being alone._ Learning to be alone and enjoying the silence has been an important skill for me. Being alone and lonely are two different scenarios. You can feel lonely when surrounded by people.

(c) _Participate in the broader community._ Be part of outreach activities, conferences, graduate student activities, where you meet fellow Ph.D. Interestingly, I have found Reddit to have wonderful communities, as part of their subreddits, to connect with individuals across the globe who share similar (and sometimes strange) interests.

### Useful skills to navigate your Ph.D.

**A. Consistency**

Most improvements are too small to see until time allows it to accumulate into something much larger. A lot of people get frustrated and give up before the gains become meaningful and obvious. Patience is a competitive advantage. Suprisingly, you can find success if you are simply willing to do the reasonable thing longer than most people. 

Trust in the process and believe in the effect of compounding. You will slowly but surely build upon the skills and intuition by just showing up. Being consistent permeates in improving your questioning, communications, and research skills. It also prevents overworking, which in my personal experience I have suffered immensely from at the start of my Ph.D. 


**B. Planning**

Have a rough plan about your work. I know lot of my experimental colleague have a detailed planning and schedule for their experiment, which I've seen computational research dont feel the need to. On the contrary, treat your computational simulations, codes, and models as experiments and have a thorough plan for them. Dont be too hard on yourself and over commit on the things to do. Generally I've seen I over estimate the amount of things I can get done in a day and underestimate things I can in a month. 

Knowing what you want to work on doesn't mean you'll be able to. Most people have to spend a lot of their time working on things they don't want to, especially early on. But if you know what you want to do, you at least know what direction to nudge your life in. 

**C. Note-taking and documentation**

Communication is a skill that won't only make publishing your work easier but it would help you organize your thoughts, plan your work, and sustain collaborations much better. Clear and concise writing is key to articulate your key findings and directives on the next step. Besides writing, developing genuine interest and empathy for the work of your collaborators would go a long way in maintaining a strong research ties.

**D. Learn about investing**

Life is nothing but a series of investment decisions. You are always making decisions on what aspect in your work and life deserves your attention. Learning effective ways to allocate your energy (and time), manage risk, and be driven by a process has proven helpful when managing more than one project and handle abrupt challenges. I have found learning the mental models of 'successful' investors in the finance and startup world helpful. I have put successful in quotes since the random act of success is sometimes conflated with a feeling of being successful. Internet has made learning from greats and successful people much more accessible. Learn from those who have repeated their success and thought process multiple times and consistently gained returns on their investment. 

**E. Build a network**

If I would recommend one thing to take away from this essay is this: the community, people you connect and interact with, are the single most important resource in your doctoral journey. Seek connections who interests you and aim for narrow and long interactions. University events, Conferences, Twitter, LinkedIN, and Reddit have introduced me to colleagues, friends, and mentors, who have been an immense source of wisdom and commarderie. 

I would attribute my success in finding an internship at Dow in Summer 2020 and my current job a direct result of me seeking out individuals I find interesting and have a genuine interest to learn more from them. It might seem daunting at first but believe me, in most cases, the person next to you wants to talk to you as much as you want to talk with them, just be interested and people will automatically find you interesting. Also remember that people in academia and research in general are courtesous and collaborative. Trust your instincts, life is not a zero-sum game and dont approach a person in a pure transactional sense. 

**F. Being aware**

This is extremely important. Knowing what you want to work on doesn't mean you'll be able to. Most people have to spend a lot of their time working on things they don't want to, especially early on. But if you know what you want to do, you at least know what direction to nudge your life in. As is the case with computational models, in life your models and estimates would be based on some priors. Be aware of your own biases, your assumptions, what was the thought process behind them. Articulating it helps. If you do this consistently you will start to see gaps in your logic and understanding become clear and you can work in filling them in or updating them with appropriate information. 

**G. Just do it**

"Vision without execution is just hallucination." I read this quote somewhere and it resonated with me a lot. There would be times when you feel strongly about a particular aspect of research or want to learn a particular skill. Just carve out time and pursue it. It may sound simple but it is definitely not easy. 

### Concluding thoughts

To summarize, my Ph.D. journey was a fulfilling experience of replete with self-discovery and intellectual growth. After years of looking for external validation (i.e. grades), Ph.D. is really about learning to listen to that voice inside your head, that is telling you what to value and what to do next, giving voice to your internal validation. 

It set me up on a path to become an independent critical thinker. Of course, it was a journey full of ups and downs. Looking back, I am grateful for every experience, fellow travellers and mentors I have had te fortunate to connect with, in this journey. I hope this essay is helpful to anyone considering to embark on this journey.
