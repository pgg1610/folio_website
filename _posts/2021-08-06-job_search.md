In this post I want to share my experience searching for a full-time industry job as a Chemical Engineering Ph.D. candidate. My job search coincided with the time when the world was still grappling with the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic. In midst of all this uncertainty, I was fortunate to have full-time graduate assistant position and a supportive advisor who was willing to extend my graduation timeline if things did not work out as planned. That itself made a huge difference in my search.

In spite of it, I’d be lying if I said the job search was easy. Being an international immigrant who would eventually need a work permit (OPT), the recent changes to the immigration policies made the timeline and employment window much more uncertain. This further constrained my options. 

Below is the overview of my job search process.

I started documenting the results for every job application a month into my search. Most of the applications were lost in the void and honeslty, those were ones where I had applied on a whim and directly through the portal. The ones I heard back from where either ones I had contacted the HR, indepedent recruiter, or a member of that group which future cemented the value of having a personal connection in the company. 

Few takeaways from my search: 
* You are evaluated on (3+1)Cs: Curiosity, Collaboration, Communication, and Code

**Network matters**
Cultivate your connections, reach out to them if you find an interesting role. Learn about their work. All the offers and interviews I got were through networking and knowing people or the recruiter. It genuinely helps to show interest and passion for what you are applying to. 

**Timeline** 
I learnt this the hard way. Every sector and company in that sector, depending on its size, operates on different hiring timelines. 

**Skills**
Think about skills which make you well-suited for the job; might consider learning skills besides the one directly expected in your research. 

**Questions**
Ask good questions, be interested and people will find you interesting.

**Templates**
Have a structure for questions, emails, conversation you plan to have. Have an elevator pitch of your research ready.

**Analyze**
Always ask for feedback, know what sticks and what doesn’t

**Follow-up**
Dont feel shy to follow-up on your application, it is generally appreciated to send a thank you note and show willingness

**Portfolio**
For coding related jobs it helps to have an active GitHub or a project repository. Brush up on your coding skills since couple of roles would use some sort of coding exercies to pre-screen candidates. 

Sources to practice coding: 
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/)
- [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com)
- [StrataScratch](https://platform.stratascratch.com/)
- [Pynative](https://pynative.com)

**Get good at “sales”**
Self-belief alone is not sufficient—you also have to be able to convince other people of what you believe. Getting good at communication, particularly written communication, is an investment worth making. 


Zooming in, below are few things to keep in mind as you start your job search: 

### Mise en place (the prep)

1. Make a skeleton CV (long-form) and a Resume, cover letter (broad, specific). Dont hesitate to take help from your career oppoturnuties office at your university, your friends, and mentors who are already in the industry, eg: [Purdue OWL writing resources](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/job_search_writing/preparing_an_application/writing_statements_of_teaching_philosophy.html)

2. List of things/areas you would want to pursue
    * What skills/experience in your PhD make you good fit for that position

3. List of companies that interest you
    * What I have found to be useful is make an account on the company portal and scan for jobs there rather than get lot of noise from indeed or linkedin

4. Networking
    * Reach out to people who are in the position you would want to be in
    * Follow-up with your colleagues and seniors students who are currently in industry 
    * Don’t hesitate to mail/message them for their experience, career trajectory, possible positions opening in their group
    * Have a ice-breaker message ready --
    "Hi, I’m ___ and I am ___ interested in applying __ to catalyst discovery. I am very interested in ___ and would love to get five minutes of your time to tell you about me. Can we chat sometime soon? (Informal colleage/person on linkedin)" -- you can add more meat here

### Once you land an interview

I feel most of the time technical questions are not going to be a problem it would come down to the questions you would ask and the inter-personal HR-like questions

Few things to be keep ready: 

* Elevator pitch for your research (ELI5, explain like I'm 5 version of your PhD)
* Broad impact of your work, how does your work apply on the larger scale
* HR/behaviour questions: STAR method prep -- Situation | Task | Action | Result. Choose 3-4 stories which highlight your contributions and skills, break them down in STAR format. [Amazon leadership principles](https://passmyinterview.com/amazon-leadership-principles-interview/) are a nice source of question that you might encounter.

#### Conversations 

> “To be interesting, be interested.” - Dale Carnegie 

* Dont ask them questions you can find on Google
* Read the role posting and company portfolio carefully

Some questions you might consider asking your interviewers: 

**Their Role**

- What is your day-to-day like?
- What are your most/least favorite aspects?
- How do you manage workload? 
- _What are the most important problems in your field?_

**Their Path**

- How long did it take to progress through each stage?
- Favorite failure which set you up for eventual success? 
- _Knowing what you know now, what are some misvalued asset in the world?_

**Advice**

- _What kind of skills should I build to prepare to enter this career?_
- What are some books I should read/conferences I should attend?
- Who should I talk to next?
