As suggested by [Michael Pollan](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/02/10/803394030/michael-pollan-explains-caffeine-cravings-and-why-you-dont-have-to-quit) I tried to go without caffiene in any form for few days. The best I could last is two until I found it affecting my work, research, more importantly my relationship with my wife. That made me think how dependent I have become to this fairly benign looking psychoactive whose consumption and depedence seems to have become the baseline expected way of life, atleast in the USA. Alcohol and caffiene are two exogenous psychoactives who consumption, and in lots of cases, dependence doesnt register any reaction in the public; instead people judge you if say you dont consume either one or neither of those. Some how the person who doesnt consume these drug is seen as a heretic.

This interesting status-quo in our lives got me thinking, who do we consider an addict? We know the ones on 'hard' drugs are labelled as such. Media is full of stories showing the lengths people go to satisfy their cravings for potent drugs. But what about some of the more non conspicuous forms of additions? What about those who are addicted to approval, attention, and appreciation of others? What lengths to people go to, who are addicted, to fame, success, money, power, and prestige go to? The first example we can suggest are the absurb 'pranks' and 'hacks' people undergo to get social media clouts. But what about people in organimization or in our personal lives who crave approval and attention. How many times does this addiction come in between intellectual honesty or benefit of the soceity?

Those of who are addicted to it, our happiness is in hands of external consequences. A lot of times money, fame, following doesnt solve the pit of despair and lonliness we feels; so what is the use of this addiction? To move beyond this dependence we have to stop viewing others as means to satisy our addiction - so no one has power to make it happy. Patience, compassion, and communing with yourself might be ways to balancing this.
