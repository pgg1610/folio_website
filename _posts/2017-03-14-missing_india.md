On the outside America is awesome. From an Indian tourist perspective it's a dream land but on a closer look I have realized America is super weird. For one, it lacks the vibrance and color India has, I do not know for sure if it as dirty as the subcontinent. I never would have thought I would say this, but I miss India. All it's dirty, ruggedness and chaos. There's some order in the randomness there. While Americans are disciplined, clean and punctual somewhere I miss the emotional connect which the Indians emanated profoundly. It might be the language or the culture or the climate -- geographical social or political -- but in India I felt I was a part of huge family. Something which is lacking here. Next, America has TOO MANY rules. Driving here is boring. While it's true that there are wide clean roads, lush greenery , open country fields and impeccably planned intertwined highway network make your jaws drop. For me that awe was ephemeral. Soon that novelty faded and what left were boring monotonous highways with insanely large vehicles going at insanely high speeds. I miss those colorful trucks or those packed busses or motorcycles with 5 people on them. Those rustic outposts which served fresh sugarcane juice and doubled as navigators. Every road trip whether rural or urban in india was an adventure.
