Life is anything but a disney movie. Unlike a disney movie it is difficult to categorize any one as a hero or a villain. 

We have grown up on that idea and wish to compartmentalize our experience/idols/peers in that simplistic mould of good-bad or hero-villain. 

But in reality everything lives on a spectrum. No one is absolutely bad (except Hitler), but rather is very much based on the context. 

Similarly every success can’t be attributed to a single person or a event. In fact it is an amalgamation of long series of seemingly unconnected events. You can’t just attribute Apple's success to Steve Jobs or Tesla's to Elon Musk. Sure they were instrumental, but so were countless engineers and the conditions which made the rise possible.
