Why Write in the Age of AI? When AI can code, search, and even finish your sentences — why bother writing at all?

Because writing is how we think. Not how we say we think, but how we actually figure out what we believe. Most ideas sound true until you try to write them down. Then you find the holes, the contradictions, the parts borrowed from someone else. But it also helps you uncover the throughline, solidify your vision and sharpen it.

AI gives us access to anything. But access without curiosity is just noise. These tools can do almost everything—except decide what’s worth doing. That part is still up to us.

Writing helps you slow down and examine your thoughts. It’s how you test what matters to you. In a world of infinite autocomplete, it’s one of the last ways to stay original.

Yes, we’ve lost skills to technology before. Most people don’t navigate by themselves by anymore. What matters now isn’t how you get somewhere—it’s whether you knew where you wanted to go in the first place. How we use this power of navigating anywhere, anytime, to explore freely and experience the world. 

AI can help you play the game. Writing helps you decide what game to play. So write. Not because you have to, but because it’s how you stay sharp. In the age of agentic AI, don’t just consume. Compose. Don’t just react. Reflect. Ask better questions. Then try to answer them yourself.
