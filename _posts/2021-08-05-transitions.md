Transition phrases are writing devices which help bridge ideas and guide the reader through the prose. When used strategically and _sparingly_ they make author's thought process more clearer to the reader. 

Transitions phrases as also helpful even when delivering talks. Sprinkling them in your talk helps make necessary connections between present slide and the information in the previous slide, which is not directly available to your audience. 

Below listed are some examples of transition phrases I tend to visit periodically. I have categorized them roughly based on the function.  

**Connect and follow-on an idea**

| furthermore             | as an example         | in fact               |
| likewise                | for instance          | moreover              |
| for example     	  | as well as        	  | similarly       	  |
| another reason  	  | along with        	  | whereas         	  |
| again           	  | coupled with      	  | simply said/put 	  |
| correspondinly  	  | speaking of       	  | in turn               |
| identically     	  | along those lines 	  | in addition to        |                 	

*** 

**Words that show cause**

| accordingly             	| otherwise             	| as you can see       	|
| as a result             	| as is the case today  	| for all those reasons |
| because                 	| so then               	| presumably           	|
| consequently            	| subsequently          	| this after all       	|
| due to                  	| therefore             	| whereas              	|
| hence                   	| this is why           	| simply said      	|
| for this purpose/reason 	| incidently            	| it stands to reason  	|
| perhaps                 	| following this        	| as was typical       	|

***

**Words that show contrast**

| instead            	| nevertheless 	| although       	|
| on the other hand  	| in contrast  	| however        	|
| on the contrary    	| whereas      	| even though    	|
| other than         	| yet          	| different from 	|
| besides            	| even though  	| that said      	|
| otherwise          	| however      	| nonetheless    	|
| notwithstanding    	| conversely   	| as opposed to  	|

*** 

**Words that add emphasis**

| certainly               	| certainly          	| in essence         	|
| no doubt (undoubtedly)  	| of course          	| unquestionably     	|
| indomitably             	| obviously          	| especially         	|
| above all              	| particularly       	| for the most part  	|
| as a rule               	| in effect          	| chiefly            	|
| it stands to reason     	| in this situation  	| primarily          	|
| in fact                 	| indeed             	| surely             	|
| specifically            	| with this in mind  	| another key point  	|

**Summary**

| in brief            	| in short           	| wrapping up         	|
| to sum up           	| to conclude        	| circling back       	|
| in sum              	| in the end         	| given these points  	|
| all in all          	| by and large       	| ultimately          	|
| as a rule           	| in effect          	| chiefly             	|

***

**Concessionary**

| that being true     	| to be sure         	| of course           	|
| naturally           	| granted            	| admittedly         	|
