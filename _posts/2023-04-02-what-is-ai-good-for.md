# Not-Bad Interns

Kevin Kelly describes the current generation of AI—whether in NLP, LLMs, or Generative AI—as "not bad interns." These models, while impressive, show both remarkable intelligence and glaring deficiencies. Their simplicity and ease of interaction have revolutionized various domains, enhancing productivity and reshaping work methodologies. Here's how I use AI in my daily workflow and the broader implications of this technology.

## Practical Uses of AI in My Daily Life

### Everyday Coding and Scripting

AI is an indispensable tool for me, especially in coding:
1. **Writing Bash Commands**: AI generates complex 'sed', 'awk', or regex commands, saving time and reducing errors.
2. **Quick Scripting Assistance**: When unfamiliar with a module or language, AI drafts scripts. For instance, I needed a BeautifulSoup script to scrape websites for links to download with 'wget', and AI provided it seamlessly.

### Enhancing Report Writing and Project Planning

AI plays a crucial role in my writing and planning:
1. **Identifying Flow Gaps**: AI helps pinpoint inconsistencies or gaps in reports, ensuring coherence.
2. **Brainstorming and Ideation**: AI outlines steps and suggests methodologies, overcoming writer's or coder's block.

### Tools I Rely On

1. **ChatGPT Web Interface**: Primarily for coding assistance due to its detailed explanations.
2. **Perplexity.ai**: Complements Google search by providing citations, invaluable for research.
3. **Github Co-pilot** : Coding assistant to do mundane tasks, write unit tests and docstrings 
4. **Microsoft Co-pilot** : Summarize email thread, chat messages, and find past conversation context 

## The Benefits of Democratized AI

AI's widespread accessibility is akin to how torrent and peer-to-peer services revolutionized online content consumption, leading to innovations like iTunes and Spotify. This democratization fosters creativity, allowing individuals to build models and automate tasks with minimal coding knowledge.

### Applications in Creativity and Automation

- **Starting Ideas**: AI generates initial concepts, helping overcome creative blocks.
- **Automating Tasks**: AI excels in automating mundane tasks, such as information extraction and data tabulation.

### Gell-Mann Amnesia and AI

Just as journalistic content may seem convincing until scrutinized by an expert, AI-generated content can appear accurate but contain errors in familiar subjects. This underscores the importance of understanding AI's limitations and the necessity for human oversight.

## Impact on Jobs and Society

### Job Displacement and Creation

AI will displace some jobs while creating new ones, similar to the rise of data scientists and engineers over the past two decades. Understanding AI's limitations and potential dangers is crucial, emphasizing ethical considerations and responsible usage.

### Ethical and Societal Implications

AI's development raises significant ethical questions and concerns about safety and governance. It mirrors human qualities, amplifying both positive and negative traits, underscoring the need for responsible development and deployment.

## Conclusion

While AI currently serves as a "not bad intern," its potential to transform workflows and creativity is immense. By understanding its strengths and limitations, we can harness its capabilities responsibly to drive innovation and productivity. As we navigate this exciting frontier, let's stay curious, cautious, and optimistic about the future of AI.
