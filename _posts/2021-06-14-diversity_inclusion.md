Homogeneity breed complacency, complecancy results in stagnation. 

Having diverse thoughts, ideas, and discussion central to progress. Comtemplation and deliberations on mutliple point of view help challenge the norms and questioning the status quo.

One prominent example that comes to my mind as someone who benefitted from climate of diversity was Leonardo Da Vinci. He is as much a product of his intellectual prowess as the flourishing heterogeneous collaborative society of medieval 15th century Florence. It was the epicenter of artists, sculptors, blacksmiths, engineers, traders, merchantsm, and economist working closely. 

Below are list of few nice articles I have read on the topic of [Diversity & Inclusion](https://pgg1610.github.io/blog_fastpages/exploratory-data-analysis/machine-learning/resources/2021/06/25/ML_resources.html#diversity--inclusion)
